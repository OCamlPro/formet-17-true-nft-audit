This informal audit details the functionning of the TrueNFT smart
contracts of the FreeTon repository.
%
The {\tt true-nft-core} directory contains a simplified version of a
more complex NFT project; it only contains a high level version,
synthesizing the storage of the different contracts, so as to retrieve
them with DeBots (the DeBots code were not part of the audited
contracts).
%
This report contains a full review of the code with the different issues, from 
minor to critical, that were found and fixes are proposed in some cases.

We found 2 issues that we qualified as Critical, and 5 issues that we
qualified as Major. Some of the issues were sent to the authors
through private exchanges on Telegram.

This document is the submission to the 17\textsuperscript{th} contest
of the ForMet sub-governance, which is accessible
